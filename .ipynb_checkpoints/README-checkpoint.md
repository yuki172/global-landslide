# Data Sources
1. This project uses the Global Landslide Catalog dataset exported from the NASA's Open Data Portal https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Export/dd9e-wu2v/about_data

As required by the host page, we cite the following two sources

Kirschbaum, D. B., Adler, R., Hong, Y., Hill, S., & Lerner-Lam, A. (2010). A global landslide catalog for hazard applications: method, results, and limitations. Natural Hazards, 52(3), 561â€“575. doi:10.1007/s11069-009-9401-4. [1]

2. We will also use the GDP by country dataset obtained from https://github.com/datasets/gdp/blob/master/data/gdp.csv.

# Project Objectives
We would like to understand the relationship between casualties (fatality_count and injury_count) and other variables from the datesets such as event time and country GDP in landslide events. We will use explorative data analysis and build interpretable regression models toward this goal.
